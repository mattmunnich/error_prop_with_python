# Error Propagation using Python and the Uncertainties Package
Notes how to use python to calculate errors and more in a basic physics lab course

These are a few jupyter notebooks to show how to use the
  -  *Uncertainties* package for error propagation;
  -  *SciPy* for curve fitting  (linear regression) with error estimates;
  -  *Pandas* package instead of a spreadsheet.

In a basic physics lab course for non-physicists.
