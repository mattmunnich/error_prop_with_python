### Error Propagation Examples with Python Uncertainties 
Notes how to use python to calculate errors and more in a basic physics lab course

These are a few jupyter notebooks to show how to use
  - the *Uncertainties* package for error propagation;
  - the *SciPy* optimisation or stats fitting for linear regression with error estimates;
  -  *Pandas* package instead of a spreadsheet.

in a basic physics lab course for non-physicists.
